I am in the process of getting this figured out now.\n\nI want to clarify that when I say scam I do not mean directly taking money from the elderly and providing nothing. My whole job is just to get old people to give me their address (&gt;120/day). How I am told to go about doing this is less than honest but also I do not believe actually illegal. It is a large multinational company (as some have guessed in the comments Haneco Lighting, although they also hire on WaterlooWorks under JLW Inc). It is scam-like and feels gross, but also not fraud or anything.\n\nThank you again for the support and advice. I'd prefer to remain anonymous here so I won't reach out to anyone on here (although thank you for reaching out) but be assured that through this post I have found the correct channels.\n\n## **Original Post**\n\n---\n\nMy first co-op is working in a scam call center and I don't think I can get out. Is there anything I can do?\n\nI'm in engineering and I got a few interviews but still had no job until the continuous round. Then I interviewed for this company, they framed it like a sales job but with some tech (led lighting) involved and working with businesses on the electrical implementation. It seemed not the best but I needed a job so applied.\n\nI did the interview and I asked but they told me basically nothing about the job. I have the job now..\n\nBut it is nothing like I thought. I am forced to cold call elderly people all day and attempt to extract information from them, get their address and lie to them. Even in the training they told us 5+ times how it isn't a scam but it basically is.\n\nThe thing is that they technically didn't lie about what the job was. They mentioned cold calling in the WW job post but I thought that would just be a small part of the job. And they didn't lie, it is related to led lighting systems.\n\nThey also put up scare tactics for us, told us some shit about how they had to fire someone and they failed the whole work term and had to drop out because they couldn't get another one.\n\nI talked with my co-op advisor but didn't get any help\nIt seems like whatever I do it will risk my entire co-op program. The company owns me. I feel completely trapped. The managers also watch us on the cameras all day. If I get a fail for my first work term I will never be able to get a second one.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get out of this without risking my whole degree?\n\nEdit: someone already put it in the comments so I'm sure they've found this now (they claim to use automated Internet scraping to find anything you say about them), the company is Haneco Lighting.

Yet we all know that's obviously not the system is currently being used (cough cough Conestoga College).\n\nIt's kinda shocking how ridiculously hard it's become to find a part time job outside school in the KW region. Canadians looking for part time jobs (usually high school or uni kids) are literally competing with thousands of internationals.\n\nI'm from the KW region. It took my little brother months to find a part time job (it was not this hard for me in high school).\n\n**Why has the University not done anything to address the fact that Conestoga College literally increased the # of internationals by like 20,000 in a few years? Not even a statement?**\n\nOH AND Don't even get me started on housing. There's literally a shortage of 5000 student beds because Conestoga College won't stop increasing its numbers, completely uncontrolled. I literally know of Canadian students here in Waterloo that are homeless living in campus buildings full time.\n\nI think that even a 20 hour/week limit is too relaxed. This might've worked when the region only had a few hundred internationals like it did 10 years ago. But when there's literally 10-20,000 international students in this city it genuinely makes no sense.\n\nIn my opinion:\n\n\\- Only allow International Students to work on-campus jobs (not counting co-op here). This is how it is in most countries do it\n\n**We can ALL agree that it's ridiculous that the University hasn't made any sort of statement against the clear exploitation of the system by Conestoga College.**\n\nConestoga's exploitation of the system doesn't exist in a vacuum. Literally all Waterloo students are being squeezed on crazy rent, feeling the effects of crammed transit, overburdened health clinics and diminishing job prospects in the region.\n\n**Is there literally anyone speaking up against this in the University**?? I feel like I'm going crazy I can't be the only one seeing this.\n\nEDIT: It seems like people have gotten the wrong impression from my post. **This isn't an attack on international students. I'm trying to point out that the system is very clearly being exploited**. Just to be clear, no one is benefitting from the exploitation (not even international students) except for Conestoga College and employers like Tim Hortons that refuse to raise wages\n\nEDIT 2: Just to clarify (since my title is a bit unclear), I'm **not talking about co-ops here**. I meant non co-op employment (so part time/full time work during the school year)",

  "selftext": "What up yall,\n\nOn a work term rn and I and my other co-op co-workers are regretting choosing this company. It's a small company and we are on the backend team. This company has no full-time developer employees, except for one person who we never require to work with. Meaning that, we, as inexperienced students, don't get any mentorship and no one to rely on. Half our time is spent trying to make sense of what past co-ops have done and researching things from scratch. Also, since there are no full-timers, we are expected to start and finish and invent projects and present them directly to clients. I might be wrong, but this shouldn't be things that student interns are expected of.\n\nThen there's the CEO, who is the only one we report to since its a very small company. CEO is operational and is somewhat strict on expecting deliverables when we come back with organizational complaints, confusion and roadblocks. These are also tough, since all technology bugs, new ideas and requests come straight to us with no extension to existing deadlines.\n\nNow the thing that pisses me off the most. The hours. We don't get paid overtime and because of the amount of work and level of work, we are always clocking out at 8/9pm, sometimes even later. Recently, we've also been putting in weekend hours, with the CEO saying its good to be proactive and we should have accountability for our tasks, since we are behind on progress and schedule (again, no senior devs and alot for new students). We are already losing work-life balance.\n\nI only chose the job cause I didn't have other options and was desperate. I don't think CEO will fire us, cause we interns are the workflow lmao and it's not like we haven't shown results/progress. So far we've been hugging it and pushing forward. Maybe I'm just bitching about it idk, but all of us co-ops feel the same way about things so I wanted to ask yall.\n\nThoughts? Advice? lmk.",

It&amp;#39;s a small company and we are on the backend team. This company has no full-time developer employees, except for one person who we never require to work with. Meaning that, we, as inexperienced students, don&amp;#39;t get any mentorship and no one to rely on. Half our time is spent trying to make sense of what past co-ops have done and researching things from scratch. Also, since there are no full-timers, we are expected to start and finish and invent projects and present them directly to clients. I might be wrong, but this shouldn&amp;#39;t be things that student interns are expected of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the CEO, who is the only one we report to since its a very small company. CEO is operational and is somewhat strict on expecting deliverables when we come back with organizational complaints, confusion and roadblocks. These are also tough, since all technology bugs, new ideas and requests come straight to us with no extension to existing deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the thing that pisses me off the most. The hours. We don&amp;#39;t get paid overtime and because of the amount of work and level of work, we are always clocking out at 8/9pm, sometimes even later. Recently, we&amp;#39;ve also been putting in weekend hours, with the CEO saying its good to be proactive and we should have accountability for our tasks, since we are behind on progress and schedule (again, no senior devs and alot for new students). We are already losing work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only chose the job cause I didn&amp;#39;t have other options and was desperate.

KGS Research had an in-person party for Eid in May of 2020. I enjoy festivals and celebrations, but not during a pandemic, especially when we weren’t sure what was going to happen next. It had mandatory attendance. \n\nI wore a mask and socially distanced politely from people, but the boss and his brother (they’re very young, probably younger than most university students’ age) went around hugging everybody and not socially distancing. \n\nThey looked at me and told me they had a “no mask” policy (it’s a call center, they had no dress code), but I kept my mask on regardless (I just had a basic blue mask to cover my nose and mouth). They also kept reaching to hug me and I refused politely and I waved my hand to say hi nicely. They were drinking during the day and blasting music (even though drinking is not allowed during Eid). Whenever they’d see my mask they’d sarcastically ask me “Are you okay? You look like an alien!”\n\nI’m a man so I don’t believe they were being nasty by trying to hug me, they were very young so I think they were just trying to be “bros”, but this was during the pandemic and my grandmother had passed away from COVID so I didn’t want to take any risks. \n\nA few days after the party I was suddenly laid off from the company for “not being a cultural fit”. They didn’t even have the respect to tell me over the phone that they laid me off. \n\nI was given no prior warnings. Anyways, a few days after the party, they locked my company account in the middle of one of my shifts and I couldn’t log in. I had to call the receptionist and call around for an hour to get to the boss’s number and extension, who only then told me “You don’t work here anymore”. \n\nListen, this is an at-will work province, I really don’t mind, it’s in the employer’s power to lay off anybody as long as it’s not discriminatory. But please don’t waste my time making me do this, I’d rather you just told me you laid me off instead of making me do this rigmarole. \n\nNot just that, I was just communicating with many different team members before you locked my account randomly in the middle of a shift. Now 11 people are going to be confused and not get the work I was supposed to give them! \n\nYou couldn’t even give me notice so I could ensure everything was taken care of for when I left? They just chopped off the middle segment of their conveyor belt, so to speak. Of course I’m not going to be able to get any references or network from this company now. \n\nWhy’d it take me so long to call my boss? This is the kind of company where you need to give your phone number, but they won’t give you theirs, you’re pretty much on-call all days including weekends and holidays. Every time they’d call me, they’d have an “anonymous” number. To put it in perspective, even my phone number thought they were “spam” callers. \n\nI don’t know if they still make you do this, but when I applied to work there, you had to do an Excel test at 8PM that lasted for a few hours. They give you a large amount of time, but you only need an hour or less if you know how to Excel. But they give it to you late at night (for me it was a Friday night) to see how desperate you are. I knew what I was getting into, I didn’t mind working evenings and working weekends and holidays, but you’ll have no life at all.\n\nThe police/municipality had hotlines at the time to report gatherings because they were illegal at the time, but I’m not really a spiteful person, I just want to be positive and move on, so I never reported it. \n\nThe work you do there is just Excel, you won’t learn any programming or data analysis skills at all. \n\nIf you’re reading the reviews online and see a lot of people working in the call center at KGS Research complaining, you may think “Oh this position I’m applying for is not in the call center there, I’ll be fine”,  but it’s not true, they treat all co-ops and new people terribly, even if you don’t work in their call center.\n\nI won’t say what I did specifically, but I wasn’t in the call center and they treated me so horribly. The position was remote at the time but they removed remote work after 2 months into the pandemic, and they kept having mandatory gatherings/parties even when the work was remote.\n\nDuring your work shift you worked remotely, you had to be in a public call with other new co-workers during your entire shift with your camera on and your face in-frame. It caused chaos because nobody would mute themselves, everybody would be eating, using the washroom, listening to music, talking to their friends on the phone, etc, and this even includes the supervisors. They used a trial version, so you had to keep disconnecting/reconnecting every 30 minutes. \n\nThe reason for people eating in the call is because they would never give breaks. One of the other reasons I got laid off was for asking for a lunch break. You’re expected to work while you eat and you don’t get paid for it. I would order food delivery and go downstairs to bring it upstairs, it’d take me less than a minute, but because you were always in a call where your supervisor can come at anytime, I was immediately accosted to supervisors yelling “WHERE’D YOU GO?!”\n\nAlso, you get mailed physical cheques, there’s no direct deposit, so with a slow postal service due to the pandemic I was really shafted. They also try to obfuscate your pay they’ll always underpay you. You’ll regularly and randomly get asked to stay for more hours that are un-paid work. \n\nI don’t mind working extra time for no extra pay, but it was extremely sporadic and they really didn’t have respect for you. When my shift was supposed to end at 9PM I still had to work until 2AM, and was then expected to wake up 7AM for the next day shift too. \n\nYou are guaranteed to make minimum wage as well.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to put this out there because I still see them posting jobs online, I don’t want other students to make my mistake. \n\nCan you imagine how bad it is if they give you a bad ratings or even fire you? Employers read your co-op ratings and in my day they were extremely inflated, if you didn’t have Outstanding or Excellent you’d have an extremely difficult time. \n\nYou think CECA is going to help you? LOL!\n\nKGS Research only taught me what not to do in a workplace, the place is extremely toxic and not worth it. \n\nI worked at better jobs later on, talked to people I trusted, and they’d laugh at what I told them because no other workplace is so bad. Again, I have mentioned no names, never mentioned what the company even does, etc so I’m hoping this can stay up. \n\nStay safe with the pandemic!  \n\nTLDR: If you’re wondering if what everyone says about KGS Research being horrible is true, the answer is “yes”. There’s a reason they only have &lt;10 people applying for their job each term. It’s not even just the fact that the pay is low, the supervisors/bosses are horrible and disrespect you, you need to work extra hours with no overtime pay, and mandatory weekend and holiday work, mailed paper cheques, and it’s not a remote position anymore. It’s genuinely stressful and my hair turned white.",

It’s only 2 days in office so I’m not that stressed but I would love to hear op from anyone that’s commuted for co-op or lives in Toronto - thanks !! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If I knew I would end up this low I honestly would&amp;#39;ve not come to Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The experience and pay is really nice, but I&amp;#39;m worth so much more than a start-up in Hamilton. This is going to be the worst summer ever. My life is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But I decided not to stick with them because diversity looks good on a resume. \n\nI've been searching high and low for a co-op for Winter 2024 that fits my needs and what I want as an engineer. Unfortunately most of the jobs were either internships or software related (I wanna work in hardware). Obviously my resume and my grades secured me interviews, but I'd ask what a day in the life looks like and they all sound like 9 to 5 office jobs. I'm more than a 9 to 5 office job.\n\nI ended up getting 3 offers (all of which suck) and I went with the lesser of 3 evils. But after talking to many of my classmates who have found placements, I know I made the wrong decision. It's a crappy start-up, and when you google the office building (if you consider 2 floors to even be a building) it looks absolutely horrid. The bricks of the building are brown and probably haven't been cleaned in years. Not to mention how small it is too.\n\nOne of my buddies is working in America while getting 50% of his rent paid. I know multiple people who got co-ops in America while I got stuck in f\\*cking Hamilton (just saying Hamilton literally puts tears in my eyes lol, I'm so mad at myself). I know I'm smarter than most of them and more worthy of their placements so it doesn't make sense why I'm stuck in Hamilton.\n\nIt's too late now. I'm stuck in Hamilton for the next 4 months of my life. If I knew I would end up this low I honestly would've not come to Waterloo. The pay is really good, but I'm worth so much more than a start-up in Hamilton. This is going to be the worst 4 months ever. It feels like my life is over.",
